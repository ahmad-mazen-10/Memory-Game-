Test Your Memory with this Interactive JavaScript Game!

I've been working on a fun and challenging memory game built with JavaScript. Here are some key features:
Welcome Screen: Personalize the game by entering your name.
Shuffled Cards: The game randomly shuffles memory cards to keep gameplay exciting.
Matching Mechanic: Flip cards to reveal hidden icons. Find matching pairs to clear them from the board.
Time Pressure: Race against the clock to find all matches before time runs out. (Optional: You can mention if there's a timer involved)
Engaging Sound Effects: Enjoy rewarding sounds for successful matches and playful cues for mismatched attempts.
